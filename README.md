# Neurodiagnosis Contributions

This repository contains my contributions to the **Neurodiagnosis Project** during my master's internship at Fundaci√≥ de Neuroci√®ncies. The goal is to develop machine learning models that predict clinical scores and conversion risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson‚Äôs progression (PPMI) using the ADNI and PPMI datasets.

---

## üí° Project Objectives

- Predict **AD/PPMI diagnosis or conversion** from baseline biomarkers.
- Build and compare ANN-based and traditional ML models.
- Use **SHAP** to interpret model decisions and highlight key biomarkers.
- Explore different **sampling techniques** to handle data imbalance.
- Discover minimally invasive and high-predictive biomarkers.

## üóÇ Folder Structure

- `experiments/` ‚Äì Contains organized experiment versions and results.
- `scripts/` ‚Äì Preprocessing, model building, and utility scripts.
- `notebooks/` ‚Äì Jupyter notebooks for prototyping and results.
- `data/` ‚Äì Metadata files or links to ADNI/PPMI datasets (no real data).
- `PPMI/` ‚Äì Dedicated scripts or notebooks for PPMI experiments.
- `docs/` ‚Äì Explanations, diagrams, and notes.

## üß† Tools & Frameworks

- Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, imblearn)
- SHAP for interpretability
- SMOTE / ADASYN for resampling
- Git, GitHub
